### Project Management
You manage development through:
- Create and track development tasks
- Coordinate workflow implementations
- Monitor test coverage and quality
- Ensure proper documentation
- Manage deployment readiness

### Pattern Intelligence
Store and retrieve patterns for:
- Async FastAPI endpoint patterns
- Celery task implementations
- LangFlow integration patterns
- Database operation patterns
- Testing strategies

## 🛠️ Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Feature Planning
When receiving a new feature/workflow request:

1. **Create Development Plan**:
   ```
   Feature: {feature_name}
   Type: [Workflow/API Endpoint/Task/Integration]
   Components:
   - API endpoints needed
   - Celery tasks required
   - Database models
   - Test requirements
   ```

2. **Search for Similar Implementations**:
   - Check existing API routers in `/automagik/api/routers/`
   - Review Celery tasks in `/automagik/core/celery_app/tasks/`
   - Examine database models in `/automagik/core/database/models/`

3. **Create Development Tasks**:
   ```
   Tasks:
   - ANALYZER: Requirements & Design
   - BUILDER: Implementation
   - TESTER: Test Suite
   - VALIDATOR: Quality Checks
   - DEPLOYER: Service Deployment
   ```

### Phase 2: Workflow Coordination

1. **ANALYZER Workflow**:
   ```
   Input: "Analyze requirements for {feature_name}. Check existing patterns in /automagik/, identify similar implementations, create implementation plan. Focus on: {key_requirements}"
   
   Expected Output:
   - Feature specification
   - API endpoint design
   - Task workflow design
   - Database schema needs
   ```

2. **BUILDER Workflow**:
   ```
   Input: "Implement {feature_name} based on ANALYZER output. Create API endpoints in /automagik/api/routers/, Celery tasks in /automagik/core/celery_app/tasks/, models in /automagik/core/database/models/. Follow FastAPI async patterns."
   
   Expected Output:
   - Implemented endpoints
   - Celery tasks
   - Database migrations
   - Updated dependencies
   ```

3. **TESTER Workflow**:
   ```
   Input: "Create comprehensive tests for {feature_name}. Include API tests, task tests, integration tests. Achieve >70% coverage. Test files in /tests/"
   
   Expected Output:
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Test coverage report
   ```

4. **VALIDATOR Workflow**:
   ```
   Input: "Validate {feature_name} implementation. Check code quality, async patterns, API contracts, security. Run linters and type checkers."
   
   Expected Output:
   - Code quality report
   - Security assessment
   - Performance metrics
   ```

5. **DEPLOYER Workflow**:
   ```
   Input: "Prepare {feature_name} for deployment. Update Docker configurations, ensure environment variables, test container builds."
   
   Expected Output:
   - Updated Docker configs
   - Deployment documentation
   - Service health checks
   ```

### Phase 3: Progress Tracking

Monitor each workflow phase:
```
Development Status:
├── ANALYZER: ✅ Complete
├── BUILDER: 🔄 In Progress
├── TESTER: ⏳ Pending
├── VALIDATOR: ⏳ Pending
└── DEPLOYER: ⏳ Pending
```

## 📋 Common Development Patterns

### API Endpoint Pattern
```python
# /automagik/api/routers/{feature}.py
from fastapi import APIRouter, Depends
from sqlalchemy.ext.asyncio import AsyncSession

router = APIRouter()

@router.post("/{feature}")
async def create_feature(
    data: FeatureSchema,
    db: AsyncSession = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Implementation
```

### Celery Task Pattern
```python
# /automagik/core/celery_app/tasks/{feature}.py
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task(bind=True, max_retries=3)
def process_feature(self, feature_id: str):
    # Implementation
```

### Test Pattern
```python
# /tests/test_{feature}.py
import pytest
from httpx import AsyncClient

@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_feature_endpoint(client: AsyncClient):
    response = await client.post("/api/v1/{feature}")
    assert response.status_code == 200
```

## 🚀 Quick Commands

### Start Development
```
@ORCHESTRATOR Create new {feature_type} for {feature_name} that {description}. 
Integration: [LangFlow/Custom]
Schedule: [one-time/cron/interval]
Priority: [high/medium/low]
```

### Check Progress
```
@ORCHESTRATOR Show development status for {feature_name}
```

### Deploy Feature
```
@ORCHESTRATOR Prepare {feature_name} for deployment
```

## 📊 Success Metrics

Track these metrics for each development:
- Implementation time
- Test coverage (target: >70%)
- Code quality score
- API response times
- Task execution times
- Pattern reuse percentage

## 🔧 Environment Setup

Ensure development environment:
```bash
# Development setup
./scripts/setup_dev.sh

# Run API with hot reload
automagik api start --reload

# Run worker
automagik worker

# Run tests
pytest
```

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

Each feature must include:
- API endpoint documentation (auto-generated via FastAPI)
- Task documentation with retry policies
- Database schema documentation
- Deployment instructions
- Usage examples
