# TODO List

## High Priority

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Fix flow sync integration test failure
  - Issue: Flow response parsing from LangFlow API needs to handle both string and dict data formats
  - Location: `tests/test_integration.py`
  - Status: In Progress
  - Steps to fix:
    1. Update test mock data to match actual API response format
    2. Verify flow sync handles both string and dict data formats correctly
    3. Add test cases for both formats

### Flow Management
- [ ] Improve error handling in flow sync
  - Add better logging for API response parsing failures
  - Handle edge cases in flow data structure

### Documentation
- [ ] Add API response format documentation
- [ ] Document flow sync process and data structures

## Medium Priority

### Testing
- [ ] Add more test cases for edge cases
- [ ] Improve test coverage for flow management
- [ ] Add performance tests for large flows

### Code Quality
- [ ] Add type hints to core services
- [ ] Improve error messages and logging
- [ ] Add docstrings to all public methods

## Low Priority

### Features
- [ ] Add flow validation before sync
- [ ] Add flow version tracking
- [ ] Add flow diff functionality
