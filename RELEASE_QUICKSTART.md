## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### "Version mismatch" error
- Ensure `pyproject.toml` version matches your git tag (without 'v' prefix)

### PyPI upload fails
- Check if version already exists on PyPI
- Verify PyPI Trusted Publishing is configured

### GitHub release not created
- Check that tag was pushed: `git push origin --tags`
- Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY secret (optional, for AI-generated notes)

### Need to delete a tag
```bash
git tag -d v0.3.8rc1              # Delete local
git push origin :refs/tags/v0.3.8rc1  # Delete remote
```
